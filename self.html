    <h2> Q: How do transgender people perceive their gender? </h2>
    <blockquote><p>Transgender people don't identify their gender as the sex they were assigned at birth. These people are adopting forms of gender identity and expression that aren't related to their body parts or what sex they assigned at birth <a class="citation" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8483561/transgender-gender-identity-expression">(Lopez, 2015)</a>.

    <h2> Q: What types of interventions are used for transition and is it compulsory? </h2>
    <blockquote><p>Transition refers to a change in gender role. Hormone therapy and/or surgery to feminize or masculinize the body may be part of that. A change in gender role may also be part time or involve changes in some parts of gender expression and not in others.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Among the younger generation, there are transgender individuals who feel that transitioning from A to B does not apply to them. Rather, they say that they always have been C (i.e., transgender or genderqueer). In short, transition is a means to affirm gender identity, and includes steps and interventions that are implemented to varying degrees by people within this diverse community <a class="citation" href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/11/psychology-transgender">(Bockting, 2015).</p>

    <h2> Q: Does transition affect one's sexual orientation? </h2>
    <blockquote><p>A common misconception is that gender identity and expression are linked to sexual or romantic attraction. But a trans person can identify as a man, even though he was assigned female at birth, and be gay (attracted to other men), straight (attracted to women), bisexual, asexual (sexually attracted to no one), or attracted to a traditionally undefined gender. Trans women, gender nonconforming people, genderqueer people, and nonbinary people can also be sexually attracted to men, women, both, no one, or another preference <a class="citation" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8483561/transgender-gender-identity-expression">(Lopez, 2015)</a>.
