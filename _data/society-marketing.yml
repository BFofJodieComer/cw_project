- content: The advertisement of Calvin Klein, showing the picture of Jari Jones raised significant controvercies on social media <a class="citation" href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/calvin-klein-pride-campaign-jari-jones-trend/index.html"> <u>CNN, 2020</u></a>. The image of Jari Jones is almost a mixture of the most sensitive ethnic minorities and sexual minorities in the United States. 
- jari: Jones is a black first and a transgender woman at the same time, and she has a same-sex partner. In other words, CK has achieved multi-directional coverage of the most sensitive minority groups through Jari Jones. Obviously, Jari Jones is no longer a purely biological individual here, but more of a symbol under the ideological framework. The multiple political and social identities that appear in her are defined by a special term in American academic circles, which is "intersectionality".
- debate: After CK’s advertisement was released, supporters believed that CK’s approach was to promote aesthetic diversification. The use of the image of Jari Jones also reflected that the brand was listening to the voice of ordinary overweight girls. Opponents believe that this is due to CK's performance of being too "politically correct" due to the pressure of the ongoing anti-racial discrimination movement in the United States. They insist that the main purpose of advertising is to promote consumption, and Jones does not conform to the mainstream aesthetic of thinness as beauty, which will make consumers lose the desire to buy CK products.
- ending: How do you feel about this advertisement? Do you think it reflects over political correctness as a marketing strategy or the equality and respect of Transgender group?
