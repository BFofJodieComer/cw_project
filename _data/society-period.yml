- background-information: The cause of the incident was an article published in <a class="citation" href="https://www.devex.com/news/sponsored/opinion-creating-a-more-equal-post-covid-19-world-for-people-who-menstruate-97312#.XtwLnv0aEeR.twitter"><u>devex</u></a>. The article expresses respect for the LGBTQ group by using words such as "people who have menstruation", "female and non-dual sex", rather than commonly known as "female". Just over a week after the article was published (June 7), the writer of Harry Potter, <a class="citation" href=" https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269382518362509313?lang=en"> <u>J.K. Rowling</u></a> posted a message on Twitter, “'People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?” Rowling's remarks immediately caused an uproar on Twitter.  She was then accused as “Transphobia” and “ Trans-exclusionary radical feminist” (TERF). 
- rowling-defence: Faced with the accusations, Rowling responded on <a class="citation" href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269389298664701952?lang=en-GB"> <u>Twitter</u> </a>, "If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth."
