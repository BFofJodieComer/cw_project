    <p>Children’s mental and physical health are affected when they feel that their family rejects their transgender identity.  Transgender children who feel rejected by their family are more likely to attempt suicide, develop depression, use illegal drugs, and contract HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

    <p>Much like your loved one, you will be challenged with a period of transition: 
    From being the parent of a son to becoming the parent of a daughter or from having a sister to having a sibling who is agender or a brother who is transgender.

        <h2> Q: What is okay to ask and say when my loved ones are transgender? </h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            Remember, when asking these questions don’t begin with the expectation that you’ll get all of your questions answered immediately.
            It is essential that the questions you ask are coming from a place that seeks to better understand the person’s experiences and needs, not simply satisfy your curiosity.
            Here are a few suggested questions to begin this dialogue with transgender and gender-expansive adults and adolescents:
        </p>
        <p>
            {% for question in site.data.family3 %}
